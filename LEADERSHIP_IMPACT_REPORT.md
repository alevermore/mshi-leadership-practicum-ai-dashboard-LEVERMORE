# Leadership Impact Report

## Introduction & Practicum Context
This project uses public health data to explore leadership strategies for chronic disease prevention and community health improvement, focusing on diabetes risk and lifestyle factors.

## Leadership Question
How can health informatics leadership use population health data to improve diabetes prevention, engagement, and long-term health outcomes?

## Data & Methods
- Dataset: BRFSS diabetes health indicators dataset
- Type: Public health behavioral data
- Tools: Python, Excel, GitHub, AI tools
- Methods: Descriptive analytics and AI-assisted interpretation

## Key Findings
- Prevalence of diabetes risk indicators
- Lifestyle behavior patterns
- Physical activity gaps
- Health perception trends
- Diabetes prevalence indicates a substantial chronic disease burden in the population sample.
- High blood pressure rates highlight compounding cardiovascular risk factors.
- Physical activity patterns suggest gaps in preventive health behaviors.


## Leadership Analysis
This data highlights opportunities for leadership interventions in education, preventive care, community engagement, and health equity. The findings demonstrate the importance of informatics-driven leadership in addressing chronic disease prevention. Data highlights the interconnected nature of lifestyle behaviors, chronic conditions, and long-term health outcomes. Leaders can use this information to guide strategic planning, resource allocation, and community engagement efforts.
